# Student-Class
The second work about basics of cpp. Added a concept of pointer and non-regular sized table.
# Description of:
# Part 1
Student class: contains name and surname of student. 
gradeSize parameter represents the number for student’s grades.
*gradesis a pointer to integer array of grades of size gradeSize. 
Bool passingtells if a student is about to pass a semester. 
studentCountis a static parameter that counts students.
Implementing default constructor, normal constructor and copy constructor. Implementing Free , Init, Fill methods.

# Part 2
Implementing the rest of methods and operators. GetAvg –avarage of grades,Passed and NotPassed–change passing accordingly, AddGrade –adds a grade, DeleteGrade–deletes a grade, StudentCount–gives information about how many students are there, IsBetter–according to avarage tells which student is better, Operator >>, <<, == and =.

# Part 3
Class class:contains name of the educator (teacher), pupilCount–number of pupils, pointer to Student type of array of objects -pupils,ID of a class, and static int which count classes. Additionally there is enum class which represents extension of class.Creating constructor, default constructor and copy constructor.

# Part 4
Implementing every method and operator of the class: Init and Fill are similar as in Student class, Fix–deletes every student who does not pass from the class, AddPupil –adds pupil to the class, DeletePupil –deletes pupil from class, GetEx –returns string from extension for the operator <<, Operators =, ==, <<-obvious.Operators < and > which tells which class is bigger or smaller.

# Part 5
Implementing desctructor for both classes.
